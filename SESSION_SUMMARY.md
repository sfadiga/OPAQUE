# OPAQUE Framework Development Session Summary

## Session 2: MVP Pattern Implementation
**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Developer**: Sandro Fadiga
**Framework Version**: 1.1.0
**Session Focus**: MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Pattern Support

### Overview
This session focused on implementing comprehensive MVP pattern support for the OPAQUE framework, providing developers with a clean architecture option for building maintainable desktop applications with proper separation of concerns.

### Major Achievements

#### 1. MVP Base Classes (`src/opaque/patterns/mvp.py`)
**Implemented three core classes:**

- **BaseModel**: 
  - Abstract base class with observer pattern
  - Automatic property change notifications via `create_property()`
  - State serialization/deserialization support
  - Built-in cleanup and initialization methods

- **BaseView** (extends QMdiSubWindow):
  - Replaces BaseFeatureWindow for MVP-based features
  - Built-in signals (view_shown, view_closed)
  - Simplified UI management with content widget
  - Standard message/error dialog methods

- **BasePresenter**:
  - Coordinates Model-View interaction
  - Automatic observer attachment to model
  - Service locator integration via `get_service()`
  - Lifecycle management (initialize, bind_events, cleanup)

#### 2. Annotation-Based Persistence (`src/opaque/patterns/annotations.py`)
**Created decorators for automatic persistence:**

- **@settings_field**: Marks model properties for settings persistence
- **@workspace_field**: Marks properties for workspace state persistence
- Both decorators store metadata in `__opaque_settings__` and `__opaque_workspace__` attributes
- Seamless integration with existing persistence managers

#### 3. Service Locator Pattern (`src/opaque/patterns/services.py`)
**Implemented application-wide service management:**

- **BaseService**: Abstract base class for services
- **ServiceLocator**: Manages service registration and retrieval
- Integrated into BaseApplication with `register_service()` and `get_service()`
- Enables shared functionality across features

#### 4. Enhanced BaseApplication
**Added MVP support while maintaining backward compatibility:**

- New `register_feature()` method for MVP-based features
- Creates presenter instances on-demand with proper parent/app references
- Fixed workspace manager initialization bug (was missing in `__init__`)
- Supports both legacy BaseFeatureWindow and new MVP patterns simultaneously
- Integrated service locator for application-wide services

#### 5. Updated Persistence Managers

**SettingsManager enhancements:**
- Now collects both Field descriptors and @settings_field annotations
- `_collect_annotated_settings()` method for annotation discovery
- Automatic model registration and value synchronization
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing BaseModel approach

**WorkspaceManager enhancements:**
- Collects @workspace_field annotated properties
- `_collect_annotated_workspace_fields()` method
- Automatic state save/restore for MVP models
- Compatible with both legacy and MVP patterns

#### 6. Complete MVP Example (`examples/mvp_example/`)
**Created comprehensive example demonstrating:**

- **Calculator Feature**:
  - Full MVP implementation with Model, View, Presenter
  - Settings persistence via @settings_field (precision, theme_color)
  - Workspace persistence via @workspace_field (last_result, memory)
  - Observer pattern for model changes
  - Clean separation of concerns

- **Data Viewer Feature**:
  - Table-based data viewing with MVP pattern
  - Settings and workspace persistence
  - Import/export functionality
  - Service integration for data management

- **Services**:
  - LoggingService: Centralized logging with levels
  - DataService: Shared data storage and retrieval
  - CalculationService: Calculation history tracking

- **Mixed Patterns**: Shows legacy and MVP features coexisting in same app

#### 7. Documentation
**Created comprehensive documentation:**

- `MVP_PATTERN_DOCUMENTATION.md`: Complete guide to MVP implementation
- Updated `README.md`: Added MVP pattern section and migration guide
- Examples with step-by-step explanations
- Best practices and design guidelines

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Observer Pattern in BaseModel
```python
def create_property(self, name: str, initial_value: Any = None):
    """Creates a property with automatic notification"""
    # Stores value in private attribute
    # Creates getter/setter with notification
    # Notifies all attached observers on change
```

#### Presenter Lifecycle
```python
1. __init__: Creates model and view, calls super().__init__
2. BasePresenter.__init__: 
   - Attaches to model as observer
   - Connects view signals
   - Calls initialize() and bind_events()
3. On view close: Calls save_state() and cleanup()
```

#### Annotation Collection Process
```python
# In persistence managers:
1. Iterate through presenter's model class attributes
2. Check for __opaque_settings__ or __opaque_workspace__ metadata
3. Extract field information and default values
4. Register fields for persistence
```

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `src/opaque/patterns/mvp.py` - MVP base classes
- `src/opaque/patterns/annotations.py` - Persistence decorators  
- `src/opaque/patterns/services.py` - Service locator pattern
- `examples/mvp_example/` - Complete MVP example application
- `MVP_PATTERN_DOCUMENTATION.md` - MVP implementation guide

#### Modified Files
- `src/opaque/ui/core/base_application.py` - Added MVP feature registration
- `src/opaque/persistence/managers/settings_manager.py` - Added annotation support
- `src/opaque/persistence/managers/workspace_manager.py` - Added annotation support, fixed bug
- `README.md` - Added MVP documentation

### Testing Performed
1. ✅ MVP example runs without errors
2. ✅ Calculator feature works with all operations
3. ✅ Data viewer displays and manages data correctly
4. ✅ Services communicate between features
5. ✅ Settings persistence works with annotations
6. ✅ Workspace state saves/restores correctly
7. ✅ Legacy examples still work (backward compatibility)
8. ✅ Mixed legacy and MVP features coexist

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility First**: All changes maintain compatibility with existing BaseFeatureWindow pattern
2. **Clean Separation**: Models have no Qt dependencies, Views have no business logic
3. **Annotation Simplicity**: Decorators provide clean, declarative persistence
4. **Service Flexibility**: Optional service locator for shared functionality
5. **Presenter Responsibility**: Presenters own the model and view lifecycle

### Migration Path
Developers can:
1. Continue using BaseFeatureWindow (fully supported)
2. Gradually migrate features to MVP pattern
3. Mix both patterns in the same application
4. Use annotations for new features while keeping Field descriptors for old ones

### Future Enhancements Identified
1. Unit testing framework for MVP components
2. Async support for long-running model operations
3. Data binding helpers for common View-Model synchronization
4. Code generation tools for MVP boilerplate
5. Plugin architecture leveraging service locator

### Breaking Changes
None - Full backward compatibility maintained.

### Dependencies Added
None - Uses only existing PySide6 and Python standard library.

### Performance Considerations
- Annotation collection happens once at startup
- Observer pattern has minimal overhead
- Service lookups are O(1) dictionary operations
- No significant performance impact observed

### Known Limitations
1. Models must inherit from BaseModel for annotation support
2. Presenters must implement initialize() and bind_events() methods
3. Services are application-wide (no scoped services yet)

### Commands for Testing
```bash
# Test MVP example
cd examples/mvp_example
python main.py

# Test backward compatibility
cd examples/basic_example  
python main.py

# Run all examples
python examples/mvp_example/main.py
python examples/basic_example/main.py
python examples/custom_global_settings_example.py
```

### Version Bump
- Version updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- Updated in pyproject.toml, README.md, and documentation

### Session Summary
Successfully implemented a complete MVP pattern architecture for the OPAQUE framework while maintaining full backward compatibility. The implementation provides clean separation of concerns, automatic persistence through annotations, and a service locator pattern for shared functionality. The framework now offers developers a choice between the simpler BaseFeatureWindow pattern for basic features and the more structured MVP pattern for complex applications requiring better testability and maintainability.
